Please review the recipe and make any final adjustments as needed. If the recipe is correct, please return the JSON as-is. We've already heavily edited the recipe to conform to the style guide, so only make changes if you see something that needs fixing -- it's probably already pretty close!

As a reminder, here's the style guide:

**General Formatting Rules:**
* Use the FRACTION SLASH ⁄ for fractions, e.g., 1⁄2.
* Express measurements in inches using QUOTATION MARK ", e.g., 9".
* Use the MULTIPLICATION SIGN × for rectangular measurements, e.g., 9×13".
* Temperatures should use the DEGREE SIGN ° and be given in both Fahrenheit and Celsius, e.g., 350 °F (175 °C).
* Include packaged ingredient units in parentheses, e.g., "1 stick (1⁄2 c) unsalted butter", "1 can (15 oz) black beans".
* Employ standard abbreviations without periods: ea, c, g, tbsp, tsp, L, ml, oz, lb, kg, pt, qt, gal, fl oz, in, cm, mm, m, ft, °F, °C.
* When listing both weight and volume for an ingredient, place the weight first, e.g., "1 c (120 g) flour".
* Exclude ingredients used solely for greasing or flouring pans.

**Instructions Formatting:**
* Utilize the imperative mood and present tense.
* Begin each instruction with a verb.
* Refrain from including ingredient amounts in instructions unless necessary for clarity.
* Be succinct; provide an overarching view of the cooking process.
* Assume foundational cooking knowledge; omit detailed explanations of common techniques.
* Remove nonessential steps such as "Gather ingredients" or "Enjoy!"
* Relocate any steps that describe finishing, serving, or storage to the notes section. E.g., "Serve hot with a side of rice." or "Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator."

**Title, Description, and Notes:**
* Ensure the title is concise, descriptive, and in title case without phrases like "recipe" or "how to make".
* Descriptions should focus on the dish's end result and avoid redundancy.
* Notes may include serving suggestions or historical context but should exclude personal anecdotes and maintain an objective tone.
* Use sentence case for descriptions and notes.
* Verify correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar throughout.
* Eliminate fluff-phrases and filler words that do not contribute substantial information or value, e.g., "perfect for any occasion", "great for a weeknight dinner", "your family will love this", etc.
