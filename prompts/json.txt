Convert the recipe to JSON format.
Unless the recipe is already grouped, please put all of the ingredients in a single ingredient group and all of the instructions in a single instruction group, both with empty titles.
If the recipe is already grouped, please preserve the existing groupings.

Here is an example of the JSON format:
```json
{
  "title": "Recipe Title",
  "description": "Optional introductory text.",
  "ingredient_groups": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "ingredients": [
        "Ingredient 1",
        "Ingredient 2",
        "Ingredient 3"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "instruction_groups": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "instructions": [
        "Step 1",
        "Step 2",
        "Step 3"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Optional notes."
}
```
